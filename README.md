**2. Distribution of Album vs Single Tracks**

Proportion of listening time dedicated to albums versus singles. The data indicates that 85.68% of the total listening time is spent on albums, while 14.32% is dedicated to singles. This suggests a preference for longer and more cohesive musical experiences over individual tracks. Also, this reflects a structured, analytical mindset that seeks to understand the bigger picture before making decisions or taking action.

**3. Distribution of Billboard vs Unrated Tracks**

This chart compares the distribution of songs that are part of Billboard-listed tracks versus unrated songs. A significant majority, 79.65%, corresponds to unrated songs, while 20.35% are Billboard hits. This finding highlights the inclination towards exploring lesser-known or independent music outside mainstream trends.

Favoring music outside mainstream charts demonstrates curiosity and the ability to explore alternatives beyond popular trends. This highlights adaptability and creativity in finding innovative solutions. This skill aligns well with roles that demand innovative thinking, such as process improvement or the adoption of emerging tools and methods.

**4. Listening Time Distribution by Genre**

Rock dominates with over 200k minutes listened, representing 53% of the total time. This highlights a strong personal affinity toward this genre. Electronic music ranks second, contributing to 76% of cumulative listening time. Other genres like pop, funk, and Latin music make up the remaining 24%. Over 85% of listening time is focused on just two genres (Rock and Electronic). This indicates a highly specialized taste in music.

While the primary genre is predominant, certain secondary genres account for a substantial amount of listening time, indicating a moderate diversity in musical tastes.

**5. Listening Time Distribution by Subgenre**

Pop Rock is the most listened-to subgenre, with 80k minutes (22%), followed by Alternative Rock at 34%. This reflects a preference for more modern and varied styles within Rock. Subgenres like Progressive House, Disco, and Nu Metal are represented, showing some diversity but with a predominant focus on Rock and Electronic. Less-represented subgenres (Synth Pop, J Rock, etc.) could be explored further to diversify the musical experience.

Pop Rock and Alternative Rock subgenres dominate the accumulated listening time, accounting for nearly a quarter of all minutes. This indicates a strong preference within these primary genres. Compared to the overall genre distribution, there is a more even spread among subgenres. This suggests listeners are delving deeper into their favorite styles. Although subgenres like Synth Pop and Progressive House have lower listening times, their presence hints at a curiosity to explore less mainstream genres, reflecting an openness to new musical experiences.

This analysis points towards a balanced personality: a desire for familiar styles combined with a willingness to discover new music. It could also suggest an analytical mindset that can identify trends and explore alternative options with a strategic curiosity.

**6. Listening Time by Hour of the Day**

Distribution of listening time across different hours of the day. The highest listening activity occurs around 8 AM, with over 74,157 minutes dedicated to music at this time. Other notable peaks occur around 6 PM and 8 PM, suggesting that listening habits align closely with evening leisure periods. Lower activity is observed in the early morning and late-night hours. The concentrated listening times in the morning suggest that music is a primary activity for relaxation or focus before and after work hours.

High listening activity during morning hours suggests optimal performance in quieter, distraction-free moments. This reflects an ability to focus deeply on complex tasks or adapt to flexible working hours when necessary. This tendency is beneficial for roles involving data analysis or problem-solving, especially when handling high-priority projects requiring extended concentration.

**9. Listening Time by Country**

The United States and the United Kingdom dominate the chart, indicating a preference for artists or musical styles from these regions. Argentina and Mexico are well-represented, likely due to a cultural connection with genres like Latin Rock.  While thereâ€™s a mix of countries, listening is concentrated in a few regions. This could be an opportunity to explore music from other cultures.

The inclusion of countries like Germany and Japan indicates an interest in music from less mainstream cultures. This might reflect the influence of global genres such as K-Pop or European electronic music. While Anglo-Saxon artists dominate total listening time, Latin artists have a notable presence, particularly within subgenres. The data shows that despite a focus on certain genres and regions, there's a clear appetite for exploring new sounds and cultures.
